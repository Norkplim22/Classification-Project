This is a customer churning prediction project

# Introduction
Customer attrition or churn is a huge expenditure for organizations. Customer churn is the percentage of customers that stopped using a company's product or service within a specific time period. It is a nightmare for any organisation to find out that the number of customers they started the year with have reduced. Actually, the goal is to increase sales by increasing the number of customers purchasing the organisation. if the opposite is happening, it is alarming as it is much more difficult to get new customers. 
To be able to understand this phenomenon, analysis are required to identify the factors influencing customer churn, consistently monitor churn numbers and find ways to minimize this number as customer churn can be hard to fully eradicate.

In this project, we analyzed a telco data to evaluate the possibility of a customer churning, the key indicators of thechurn and some strategies that can be implemented to retain customers.
